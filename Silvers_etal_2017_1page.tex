\section{Abstract}
Low-level clouds are shown to be the conduit between the observed sea surface temperatures (SST) 
and large decadal fluctuations of the top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiative imbalance.  The influence 
of low-level clouds on the climate feedback is shown for global mean time
series as well as particular geographic regions.  The changes of clouds are found to be 
important for a mid-century period of high sensitivity and a late century period of low 
sensitivity.  These conclusions are drawn from analysis of amip-piForcing simulations using three 
atmospheric general circulation models (AM2.1, AM3, and AM4.0).  All three models confirm the importance 
of the relationship between the global climate sensitivity and the eastern Pacific 
trends of SST and low-level clouds.  However, this work argues that the variability of the 
climate feedback parameter is not driven by stratocumulus dominated regions in the eastern ocean basins, 
but rather by the cloudy response in the rest of the tropics.


\section{Key Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Three climate models driven by observed sea surface temperatures increase then decrease climate sensitivity over the twentieth century
\item Substantial changes of the climate feedback parameter are mirrored by the global mean low-level cloud anomalies
\item This variability is connected to atmospheric stability and not dominated by stratocumulus regions, but by the broader tropics
\end{itemize}
