%abstract = {Abstract Analysis of the available Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models suggests that sea surface temperature-forced, atmosphere-only global warming experiments (“amip4K,” “amipFuture,” and “aqua4K”) are a good guide to the global cloud feedbacks determined from coupled atmosphere-ocean CO2-forced simulations, including the intermodel spread. Differences in the total climate feedback parameter between the experiments arise primarily from differences in the clear-sky feedbacks which can largely be anticipated from the nature of the experimental design. The effective CO2 radiative forcing is anticorrelated with the total feedback in the coupled simulations. This anticorrelation strengthens as the experimental design becomes simpler, the number of potential degrees of freedom of the system's response reduces, and the relevant physical processes can be identified. In the aquaplanet simulations the anticorrelation is primarily driven by opposing changes in the rapid cloud adjustment to CO2 and the net cloud response to increased surface warming. Establishing a physical explanation for this behavior is important future work.},

%abstract = {Abstract The methods to quantify equilibrium climate sensitivity are still debated. We collect millennial-length simulations of coupled climate models and show that the global mean equilibrium warming is higher than those obtained using extrapolation methods from shorter simulations. Specifically, 27 simulations with 15 climate models forced with a range of CO2 concentrations show a median 17\% larger equilibrium warming than estimated from the first 150 years of the simulations. The spatial patterns of radiative feedbacks change continuously, in most regions reducing their tendency to stabilizing the climate. In the equatorial Pacific, however, feedbacks become more stabilizing with time. The global feedback evolution is initially dominated by the tropics, with eventual substantial contributions from the mid-latitudes. Time-dependent feedbacks underscore the need of a measure of climate sensitivity that accounts for the degree of equilibration, so that models, observations, and paleo proxies can be adequately compared and aggregated to estimate future warming.},

%abstract = {Abstract A new version of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM1) is used to study the effect of cloud radiative forcing on model simulations. Previous attempts to determine the role played by clouds in climate and the general circulation of the atmosphere are reviewed first. The concept of cloud radiative forcing is discussed and the forcings in the shortwave and longwave spectral regions are contrasted. At low latitudes, the cloud longwave forcing is primarily within the atmosphere, rather than at the surface. It is thus appropriate to study its effect with a model which employs fixed sea surface temperatures (s.s.t.s). The impact of cloud longwave forcing is studied in 510-day integrations for constant January conditions. The experiments isolate the forcing by tropical and extra-tropical clouds. Tropical cloud forcing warms the tropical upper troposphere and accelerates the subtropical jets. There are subtle interactions between the forcing, the clear-sky longwave heating and the latent heating in the tropics. These additional diabatic heating terms oppose the forcing in some regions and enhance it in others. The tropical cloud forcing strengthens the precipitation maxima at low latitudes. There are also changes in the extra-tropical flow, including the excitation of a pattern in the 200 mb geopotential height differences which is similar to those found in previous studies of the effect of s.s.t. anomalies. This confirms that the forcing may be as important as latent heat release in determining the atmospheric response to such anomalies. The mode is excited with comparable strength by the extra-tropical cloud forcing. Finally, some concerns regarding the generality of these results and their applicability to other models and the real atmosphere are discussed. These concerns suggest the need for sensitivity studies, some of which are already in progress.},

%abstract = {Abstract GFDL's new CM4.0 climate model has high transient and equilibrium climate sensitivities near the middle of the upper half of CMIP5 models. The CMIP5 models have been criticized for excessive sensitivity based on observations of present-day warming and heat uptake and estimates of radiative forcing. An ensemble of historical simulations with CM4.0 produces warming and heat uptake that are consistent with these observations under forcing that is at the middle of the assessed distribution. Energy budget-based methods for estimating sensitivities based on these quantities underestimate CM4.0's sensitivities when applied to its historical simulations. However, we argue using a simple attribution procedure that CM4.0's warming evolution indicates excessive transient sensitivity to greenhouse gases. This excessive sensitivity is offset prior to recent decades by excessive response to aerosol and land use changes.},

%abstract = {Abstract Equilibrium climate sensitivity, the global surface temperature response to CO doubling, has been persistently uncertain. Recent consensus places it likely within 1.5–4.5 K. Global climate models (GCMs), which attempt to represent all relevant physical processes, provide the most direct means of estimating climate sensitivity via CO quadrupling experiments. Here we show that the closely related effective climate sensitivity has increased substantially in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), with values spanning 1.8–5.6 K across 27 GCMs and exceeding 4.5 K in 10 of them. This (statistically insignificant) increase is primarily due to stronger positive cloud feedbacks from decreasing extratropical low cloud coverage and albedo. Both of these are tied to the physical representation of clouds which in CMIP6 models lead to weaker responses of extratropical low cloud cover and water content to unforced variations in surface temperature. Establishing the plausibility of these higher sensitivity models is imperative given their implied societal ramifications.},
