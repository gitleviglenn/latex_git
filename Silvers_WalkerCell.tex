% What are climate modelers doing to reduce uncertainties about cloud processes?
The representation of clouds in climate models is the most stubborn contributor to uncertainty of the climate response to increased 
greenhouse gases.  A few of the reasons clouds are difficult to represent in models are imprecise definitions of clouds, an existential 
dependence on trace amounts of condensed water, the importance of microphysical processes at scales less than the grid-scale, 
and the close coupling between atmospheric radiative fluxes, clouds, and the large-scale dynamical circulations of Earth.  To elucidate this coupling between clouds, radiation, and the large-scale circulations of the Earth, we simulate an idealized equatorial tropical Pacific.   In the western Pacific warm sea surface temperatures prevail beneath rising atmospheric motion and deep convective storms.   In contrast, the eastern tropical Pacific is characterized by cooler sea surface temperatures and low-level, non-precipitating clouds with a dry atmosphere above the clouds.  These regions are connected by a large-scale circulation.  We analyze this scenario in a high-resolution and coarse resolution simulation and infer how deep convective heating in the west Pacific can influence the atmospheric cooling thousands of kilometers away in the east Pacific.  This cooling is a key ingredient in the determination of the Earth?s sensitivity to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations.

A high resolution (1km) cloud resolving model is used here as a benchmark to compare with the same model at lower 
resolution (25km, 100km) configured 
as a fully parameterized general circulation model.  Both models use approximately the same spatial domain.  The climate model used is derived from the most recent version of the atmospheric GCM (AM4.0) developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.  By dramatically decreasing the grid-spacing we resolve much more of the dynamical motion and eliminate some of the statistical approximations of clouds, and thus more explicitly simulate some of their impacts.

%\section{Key Questions}

\textbf{Key Points}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{At 25 km, simulations with parameterized shallow- and deep-convection exhibit asymmetries in the circulation, 
  precipitation, and humidity fields resulting in a steady-state overturning circulation that is not centered on the SST
  maximum.}
  \item{The longwave cloud-radiative effect is a fundamental factor in establishing these asymmetries and leads to dramatic
  changes in the low-level clouds and boundary layer structure.}
  \item{Cloud resolving simulations result in stronger overturning, more condensate aloft, and a RH in the deep convective 
  region that is 30\% higher than for the coarser cases with parameterized convection.}
  \item{The mock-Walker Circulation can be thought of as RCE plus an imposed gradient in surface temperature.}

\section{Introduction}

%Without question, clouds are more than passive conglomerates of tracers in a turbulent fluid.  If an advance in our understanding of the role clouds play in our climate is desired, it is essential that we 
%learn to model the two way interaction between clouds and the circulation.  The radiative influence of clouds is one of the primary mechanisms by which they influence the circulation (imp of lwcre off).  
%Our scientific motivation for this study is to illuminate/clarify the ways in which the large-scale circulation connects regions of deep convective activity with the prevalent tropical shallow 
%convection and the radiatively critical stratocumulus cloud decks.  While the meridional temperature gradient is a fundamental driver of the large-scale circulation, and the Coriolis force is 
%critical in determining the characteristics of tropical waves and the tropical extra-tropical connections, we propose that all of the physics of importance to our particular questions are present 
%in the equatorial manifestation of the Walker circulation (perhaps better in conclusion).  
%
%Current computing capabilities cannot come close to resolving all of the spatial scales which are important in the lifetime of clouds.  
%As a result, coarse resolution climate models must use statistical representations of the influences from unresolved clouds. 
%Ideally the statistics of the coarse model should represent the explicitly resolved clouds of the higher resolution model and in particular as resolution is increased and the statistical approximations eliminated, the solution of the coarse model should be informed by the solution of the high resolution model.  This approach will help to demonstrate that the influence of clouds on climate is not an intractable problem.
%
%The paradigm of the Walker circulation includes many distinct manifestations of moist convection, interactions between radiation and clouds, as well as dynamical motions which range from
%sub-kilometer scales to roughly 10,000 km.     In addition to the scientific interest of the Walker circulation as a link between deep convection, shallow-convection, and stratocumulus clouds, the tropical 
%Pacific provides an ideal physical context with which to explore the sensitivities and strengths of theoretical models, high-resolution models and general circulation models.  
%The tropical system in the Pacific Ocean including deep, shallow, and mid-level convection, as well as stratocumulus cloud decks and sea-surface temperature gradients 
%represents a fascinating and useful microcosm of the ways in which clouds can interact with dynamic circulations.
%This region of the Earth system contains clues to the difficult questions of how clouds couple to the circulation and how the nonlinear interactions within the system contribute 
%to the cloud feedbacks to perturbations and the overall sensitivity of the system to anthropogenic forcing.
%
%Several studies (Grabowski et al.,2000, Bretherton et al., 2006; Wofsy and Kuang, 2012, Kuang, 2012) have examined a 
%mock Walker circulation in the context of cloud resolving 
%simulations, or idealized theoretical models.   The comparison between CRMs and simple theory revealed several important 
%similarities (like what? See Bretherton et al., 2006) and a multiplicity of differing results (like what) for different CRM studies. 
%It thus remains unclear what GCM like models should be expected to produce in similar configurations.  
%The unique contribution from this study is to take a new CMIP6 atmospheric global climate model and to use it in the context of a
%simple mock-Walker circulation configuration while changing as little as possible from the parent model.  The model we 
%use (GFDL's AM4.0) is flexible enough to operate at grid-spacings ranging from 100km down to 1km in a doubly periodic 
%domain that is configured similar to the equatorial Pacific.  This allows us to use a single code base to compare a model 
%run at GCM-like resolution with a full suite of subgrid-scale paremeterizations with a cloud-resolving version of the same 
%model in which all convective activity is strictly explicit and many more of the important dynamic motions are resolved. 
%"Effects of cloud on atmospheric radiative cooling must be considered to get a realistic Walker circulation over specified SST. (just before equation 8 of Bretherton et al. 2006)."    

%The atmosphere of Earth constantly radiates energy to space.  This cooling of the atmosphere is mostly balanced by warming from the release of latent energy by convective clouds and precipitation.  The details of this balance between cooling and warming determine the role that clouds play in setting the Earth's climate sensitivity.  However, clouds contribute to both warming and cooling of the atmosphere.  Deep convective storms and high clouds warm the atmosphere by trapping outgoing radiation and absorbing shortwave radiation while clouds at lower levels cool the atmosphere by reflecting the incoming radiation from the sun.  Previous research has repeatedly shown that low-level clouds are the single largest factor in the current uncertainty of the Earth's climate response to a doubling of $\rm{CO}_2$ concentration (Bony and Dufresne, 2005, Sherwood et al. 2014).  However, it has also been shown that the turbulent mixing of the atmosphere by deep convective clouds provides a strong control within climate models on the climate sensitivity (Zhao, 2014).  The goal of this project is to elucidate/explore the connection between these two pieces of evidence.
%
%Previous studies such as Held et al., 1993; Tompkins et la. 1998, Bretherton et al., 2005; Muller and Held, 2012; Wing and Emanual, 2014 have shown that idealized models are quite 
%sensitive to the details of the configuration such as domain size and resolution.  This lack of convergence among high resolution models makes it difficult to know what to expect from 
%lower resolution models with convective parameterizations which are relevant to our understanding of GCMs.  Part of the purpose of this paper is to use one modeling framework to
%illustrate just what is obtained from a coarse GCM-like model run with idealized boundary conditions.  We then use this modeling framework to compare the results obtained from simulations
%with a resolution of 100, 25, 2, and 1km.
%
%The goal of designing idealized numerical experiments is to develop a tool that is easier to understand than the system the idealization 
%is based on.  The goal of adding complexity to a climate model is to achieve a more `realistic' simulation, as compared to the observed 
%world.  These simulations are somewhere in the middle of those extremes.  We have decided to keep many of the complex elements of 
%the global climate model  so that we can hopefully better understand the parent model (AM4.0) while learning something concrete about 
%the observable world.  By retaining such complexities as interactive radiation, convective parameterization, and the Tiedtke large-scale 
%cloud scheme we run the risk creating an idealized model which is no easier to understand than the original parent
%model which compares more readily to observations.  However, it is important to use idealizations such as this to test our current 
%understanding and to illuminate some of the idiosyncrasies of the climate models that are currently looked to for information about the 
%future of our climate.  The mock-Walker Circulation can be thought of as RCE plus an imposed gradient in surface temperature.  This is 
%a simple design that incorporates additional complexity which is critical for the connection to observed atmospheric phenomena.
%
%Our simulations are based on the equatorial tropical Pacific.   In the western Pacific warm sea surface temperatures exist beneath rising atmospheric motion and deep convective storms.   In contrast, the eastern tropical Pacific is characterized by cooler sea surface temperatures and low level, non-precipitation clouds with a very dry atmosphere above the clouds.  These regions are connected by a large-scale circulation of winds.  By comparing this scenario in a high-resolution and coarse resolution simulation we can infer how deep convective heating in the west Pacific can influence the atmospheric cooling thousands of kilometers away in the east Pacific.
%
%Inevitable limitations in computing power necessitate climate studies with Earth-system models to use relatively coarse grid-spacing.  
%%Coarse, statistical Earth-system models which simulate long periods of the climate are necessitated by the limitations of current computers.  
%This research uses a high-resolution cloud-resolving model on a limited spatial domain as a benchmark to compare with the same 
%model at lower resolution configured as a fully 
%parameterized general circulation model.   The modeling approach presented here, made unique by its clean connection between a global climate 
%model and a regional cloud resolving model is  made possible by the flexible modeling system at GFDL.   The goal of this paper is to use this 
%capability to better quantify and understand the connection between tropical convective heating and changes in low clouds.    

\textbf{Key Questions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{How do clouds influence the Walker Circulation?}
  \item{To what extent are the deep convective clouds and the low-level clouds in the Walker Cell coupled?}
  \item{When simulating the Walker Circulation, how well does a GCM compare to a CRM?}  
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental Details and Methods}

To develop the model configuration used for these experiments we started with the same code base as that of the AM4.0 
model (Zhao et al. a,b).  This includes the GFDL finite-volume cubed-sphere dynamical core FV3 (Harris and Lin, 2013) 
which can solve either the hydrostatic primitive equations or the nonhydrostatic fully compressible Euler equations.  Taking 
the AM4.0 physics we use the interactive radiation, deep and shallow convection, large-scale clouds, and boundary layer 
scheme as described in Zhao et al. a,b and the references therein.  The prognostic moisture variables are the specific 
humidity (q), liquid (ql) and frozen water (qi), and cloud fraction.  The top of the model domain is at 1 hPa, with 33 vertical 
levels and a sponge layer extending downward to 8 hPa.  The kilometer of atmosphere just above the surface is resolved by 
8 model levels.  The changes made to the default AM4.0 physics configuration are the following.  The cloud-aerosol 
interactions were turned off to focus on the interaction between clouds, radiation, and the circulation.  The gravity wave drag 
parameterization was turned off 
%(do_cg_drag set to .f.; Alexander-Dunkerton gravity wave drag) 
in order to reduce large oscillations in the horizontal wind field in the top of the model domain.  The convection, radiation, 
large-scale cloud, microphysics, and turbulence parameterization all remain the same as in AM4.0.  
Thus for the experiments with convective parameterization (grid-spacing of 25km and 100km), the physics are very 
similar to those of AM4.0.  This configuration can also be compared to the simulations described in 
Popp and Silvers, 2017, which used a developmental version of AM4 with almost the same changes to the physics
schemes.
For our simulations using grid spacing of 1km, 2km, and 25km (in select simulations), the double plume (both shallow and deep convection) convective parameterization was 
turned off and the time step of integration increased.

All simulations use a nonhydrostatic dynamical core, with prescribed SSTs and a doubly periodic domain which is elongated in the zonal 
direction allowing for three dimensional simulations but with a reduced computational cost relative to the global domain which is usually 
used with this model.  The SST is prescribed as a Gaussian function which is 4K warmer in the center (301K/27.85C) of the domain then at the edges (297K/23.85C).  
Thus far the GCM runs with 25km resolution have been run for 5 year.  
The 1km and 2km CRM were run for 6 months.  

The simulations with a grid-spacing of 1km and 2km are referred to as cloud resolving simulations.  For our purposes this simply means
that both deep and shallow convective parameterizations are turned off, and that the threshold of grid-cell mean relative humidity 
which triggers new clouds is changed from the default value of 0.8 to 1.0.   The Tiedtke (1993) parameterization scheme for large-scale 
clouds was designed to be used with GCMs having a coarse grid-spacing.  However, there is not a fundamental problem that we are 
aware of in using the Tiedtke scheme for large-scale clouds in a model with 1km grid-spacing.   The advantage is retaining the 
identical cloud scheme as is used in the parent GCM; the disadvantage is the greatly increased complexity of the cloud computations 
relative to many other cloud resolving models.    

One tool that has been commonly used to infer the influence of clouds on a model simulation is to make the clouds invisible to the 
radiation.  This can tell us the extent to which the specific location of the clouds matters to the radiative interaction with the atmospheric state.   This method was originally pioneered by Slingo and Slingo, 1988 and Randall et al., 1989.  More recently, it has been
implemented as part of the CFMIP series of experiments (Stevens et al. 2012).
In the AM4 code, this is done separately for the longwave and shortwave radiation.  In this study we compare control experiments, 
in which clouds and radiation are fully interactive with experiments in which clouds are
invisible to the longwave radiation.  These experiments are referred to as Longwave Cloud Radiative Effect Off (LWCRE off).  
Other than the invisible clouds, the model is the same.  Both longwave and shortwave radiation are present and interactive with 
the atmospheric state, the clouds still interact with the shortwave radiation, and they still precipitate.   
In general, turning off the longwave cloud radiative effect will have a large impact on the surface budget of a coupled model.  
However, because there is no land in our simulations and the SST is held fixed, the energetics of our experiments are not as
strongly effected as might be expected.  Experiments with only a water surface at the lower boundary and fixed SST are the
ideal configuration to utilize the LWCRE off experiments.  

\section{Results}

The results of our experiments are organized as follows.  First, the general structure and characteristics of the steady state solutions
will be described.   Then, the influence of parameterized convection and the longwave cloud radiative effect on the overturning 
circulation will be shown.  We will then briefly discuss how the circulation changes as a function of domain size.  The last part of the
results will describe and contrast the Walker circulation in a GCM-like configuration and a CRM-like configuration.

The mock-Walker Circulation that emerges from these simulations is a deep overturning circulation.  There are two circulation cells, 
one below $500 \rm{hPa}$  and one above.  Deep-convective activity dominates the region over the warm pool, shallow convection is 
common over a wider range of SSTs, and for the most part stratocumulus 
clouds are absent.  When the coupling between the circulation and clouds is broken, by turning off the longwave CRE, the atmospheric 
state is much more symmetric about the maximum SST. 

We perform a series of sensitivity experiments to highlight the different ways in which these experiments can equilibrate.  To show the sensitive 
nature of the distribution of the precipitation maximum we test the impact of convective parameterization, 
longwave radiation interactions with clouds, domain size, 
and the resolution, or grid-spacing.    Muller and Held, 2012 found that self-aggregation was sensitive to both domain size and resolution
because of the sensitivity of the low-level clouds to the longwave radiative cooling.

  \label{fig:rh_psi_P25vsE25}
\end{figure}

We find large differences among the experiments in the domain mean precipitation, condensate/clouds, and circulation.  In particular
the experiments with parameterized convection are much more erratic.  Above about 500 \textit{m} the P25 experiment
has strong domain mean wind shear that clearly influences the structure of the precipitation, as seen in 
five year Hovmoller diagrams.  The degree to which this shear influences the comparison with other experiments is unclear.    

"... the higher mean winds on the flanks of the SST maximum raise the latent heat fluxes and associated rainfall there, resulting in a 
double-peak rainfall distribution with a slight local minimum in rainfall at the SST maximum (just before eq. 8)" 
was noted by Bretherton et al., 2006.  On the page with equation 20, there is an excellent discussion of the dependence of the 
vertical structure of cumulus on two key factors.  First, temperature and moisture in the BL air where the convective updrafts originate.
Second, the moisture profile in the lower troposphere above the boundary layer.  This 'dictates the extent to which air
turbulently mixed into rising cumulus updrafts dries them out.'  I think most of our simulations with a grid-spacing of 25km or 
greater are being dominated by this second factor.

To illustrate how the double plume convective parameterization influences the atmospheric state we compare the P25 and
E25 simulations in which the only difference is that all convective parameterization is turned off in E25 (refer to a figure with
profiles for E25 and P25).  The P25 experiment represents a GCM-like configuration and compared to E25 has a stronger 
overturning circulation, higher humidity in the deep convective region, and lower humidity in the subsidence region over the 
cooler SST (Figure \ref{fig:rh_psi_P25vsE25}).  Averaged over the full domain, the parameterized convection leads to a 
dryer atmosphere with less 
condensate (both liquid and ice) and with weaker radiative cooling and condensational heating (below 800 hPa).  However, in 
the updraft region the convective parameterization results in more moisture aloft.      

One of the most prominent features of our 25km grid-spacing simulations is an asymmetry in both the time-dependent and 
steady-state solutions.  This results in the steady-state precipitation maximum locating off the maximum in SST and is apparent in 
the vertical velocity, mass circulation, relative humidity, specific humidity, and radiative heating.   A tendency of the precipitation to 
occur off of the SST maximum is also apparent in the simulations with a grid-spacing of 100km, although the 25km simulations display 
an irregularity that is greater than the 100km simulations.  Complex patterns of precipitation over a fixed sinusoidal or Gaussian SST 
distribution has been noted many times 
(Bretherton et al. 2006, Kuang and Wofsy, Ming Zhao (personal communication, see Jeevanjee et al. 2018)) but the irregularities have 
tended to be symmetric, unlike our results.   

For the simulations that are closest to the set up of a GCM, with fully parameterized convection, the steady-state circulation and 
precipitation maximum are located not over the warmest SST but shifted to regions about one degree cooler.  For the case
with a grid-spacing of 25km and a domain width of 4000km, the precipitation maximum can remain shifted off of the maximum in
SST for multiple years.   While focused within the central quarter of the domain, simulations on larger domains and with a 
grid-spacing of 100km also show an aversion to settling over the SST maximum.   When the convective parameterization
is turned off, the overturning circulation becomes weaker and broader (w, and psi), but the precipitation, cloud fields, and 
circulation all consistently reside over the SST maximum.  When the convective parameterization is turned on, a domain mean 
wind shear develops throughout the lowest 10km that acts to shift the convective activity and circulation off of the SST maximum.  
Note: check the wind shear for P25large, P100small, and P100large. 

Below is a list of several changes that occur when the LW CRE is off.  The points which have not already been discussed will be later in the paper.  

Turning the longwave cloud radiative interactions off tends to: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item decrease the strength of the overturning circulation and the domain mean precipitation
  \item increase the midtropospheric RH by $5-15 \% $
  \item eliminate the difference of liquid condensate at 900 hPa between explicit and parameterized simulations.
  \item weaken the horizontally oriented low-level circulations.   This looks connected to a contracting of relative 
           humidity maxima around 600 hPa.
  \item spread out in geographic space the precipitation maxima
  \item dramatically homogenize the surface enthalpy flux over the warm pool, primarily through the latent heat flux
  \item decrease both the LTS and the EIS, over both the warm and cold regions
%  \item in most cases the symmetry about the SST maximum is increased.
  \item decrease the lowest level $q, \theta_e,$ temperature $T$ and virtual temperature $T_v$.  
  \item eliminate large differences in the evaporation and lowest level temperature in the center of the domain between 
           the 1 and 2 \textit{km} simulations. 
  \item increase evaporation in the 1 and 2 \textit{km} cases, decrease it in the 25 \textit{km} case.
  \item amplify the larger values of ice condensate aloft for the explicit simulations.

When designing numerical experiments the size of the domain and the grid-spacing that determines model resolution are two of the most 
fundamental choices that must be made.   One the goals of this study was to explore the results of changing grid-spacing over a wide 
range of values.  To simplify the analysis we have in most cases chosen to keep the 
long horizontal dimension fixed at $4000\, \rm{km}$.  However, previous studies have documented sensitivities to domain size.  With this 
in mind several different domain shapes and sizes have been explored, but always keeping the $4000\, \rm{km}$ long-dimension as the 
primary domain for the analysis.  
Examining the evolution in time of the precipitation field reveals important characteristics of these simulations, and 
illustrates how much the distribution can vary as a function of domain size, parameterization of convection, and the effect of the 
longwave radiation due to clouds.  At all resolutions the Hovmoller plots show that the longwave CRE acts to concentrate the 
precipitation over a smaller geographic extent.  
Shown in Figure {\ref{fig:domdep}} are Hovmoller plots of precipitation after 
averaging along the short horizontal dimension.  The four panels show simulations with a grid-
spacing of $25\, \rm{km}$ on a grid with a horizontal width of $4000\, \rm{km}$ (far right) and $16000\, \rm{km}$ (middle right), and 
simulations with a grid-spacing of $100\, \rm{km}$ on a grid with a horizontal width of $4000\, \rm{km}$ (middle left) and 
$16000\, \rm{km}$ (far left).  Figure  {\ref{fig:domdep_lwoff}} shows the equivalent simulations with LW CRE off.    
The structure of the precipitation depends strongly on domain size and shows less dependence on grid-spacing.

Smaller domain lengths were found to have a more focused ascent region and larger precipitation rates in Bretherton et al., 2006.
They also found less low-level clouds over the colder SSTs in the smaller domains, relative to a control domain size that was 4x
larger.   We have found larger precipitation rates for the larger domains.  Does our larger domain ascent region change?  Does 
Brethertons SST warm patch size increase with domain size?  

% Fraction of Precip due to large-scale precip for large/small experiments with a 25km resolution

  \caption{Fraction of precipitation that is due to the large-scale(blue) cloud scheme relative to the total 
  precipitation (large-scale plus convective).}
  \label{fig:conv_vs_ls}
\end{figure}


We hypothesize than an important difference between our simulations and previous studies which use GCMs
is that although the deep and shallow convection is parameterized
with the GFDL double-plume parameterization, the fraction of precipitation that is produced by the convective parameterization 
is much smaller in our simulations than it is for many GCM-type experiments with parameterized convection.   At 25km grid-spacing, 
the majority of condensational heating occurs through the large-scale cloud  scheme.   See Figure \ref{fig:conv_vs_ls}.
%Overall, the fraction of precipitation that is 
%due to the large-scale scheme is roughly 40\%, and in many places it is actually greater than the amount of precipitation 
%produced by the convection scheme.   
%In comparison, many GCMs, have between 70\%-90\% of their precipitation produced by 
%the convective parameterization.  
There are further surprises in the fraction of precipitation that is large-scale.  On our small 
domains, with a bowling alley domain length of 4000 km, the simulations with 100km grid-spacing have values of $f_{ls}$ 
of $75-80\%$.  Often, at GCM-like resolutions such as 100km the convective precipitation would be expected to control much of the
precipitation rather than the large-scale parameterization.  However, when the domain length is increased to 16000 km
$f_{ls}$ decreases to a range of $0-70\%$ that depends strongly on location.  Over the warmest region of the surface the 
precipitation is still dominated by the large-scale scheme.  However, turning off the longwave CRE leads to a dramatic reversal 
in which $60-75\%$ of the precipitation is convective over the warmest SST.  The large domain without the longwave CRE is the 
only configuration in which the convective precipitation is dominant.    If the default, or baseline, configuration of a GCM is built 
with the expectation that the convective parameterization scheme will dominate the production of tropical precipitation, then 
perhaps a configuration that minimizes the convective precipitation will result in a balance between the parameterization 
schemes that is less intuitive, such as an asymmetric response to symmetric forcing.  

\subsection{The mock-Walker Circulation Dependence on Grid-Spacing: A transition from a 
General Circulation Model to a Cloud Resolving Model}

It is clear that the overturning circulation in the tropical Pacific encompasses dynamical motions at a host of scales and that the 
different cloud types interact with the circulation on scales ranging from meters to thousands of km's.  
Our primary motivation for using the GFDL AM4 on this doubly-periodic domain is that the dynamical core of the model can 
easily be used over a wide range of grid-spacings and can be used to solve either the hydrostatic or nonhydrostatic 
governing equations.  In this section we focus on simulations with grid-spacings that range between 1km and 100km.   
A glance at Figure \ref{fig:hov_4mods_6mn} shows notable differences in the precipitation structure that results from the 
overturning circulation at different resolutions.  Shown are the first 180 days of the P25, E25, E2, and E1 simulations.  As the 
grid-spacing decreases towards $1 \, \rm{km}$ the distribution of precipitation becomes more regular and consistently 
centered over the SST maxima in the middle of the domain.  Both the P25 and E25 simulations show more variability at later 
times, compared to these first 180 days.  Due to the large expense of the E2 and E1 simulations they were run for 
180 days.  The simulations with explicit convection at resolutions typical of cloud-resolving models (E2, E1) show little 
aversion to the precipitation maximum occurring over the maximum in SST and relative to the P25 and E25 simulations 
they are able to maintain a smoother distribution of  precipitation values over a broader range of SST values.    

The steady state relative humidity and overturning circulation show an interesting combination of similarities and differences
among the experiments with varying grid-spacing.  All experiments have a multicell vertical structure (consistent with 
Bretherton et al. 2006), in contrast to the single cell that results from simple theoretical models such as the SQTCM.   All 
show a similarly dry mid-tropospheric region where subsidence dominates.  However, the multicelled structure is quite irregular
in the P25 experiment, and a small third cell has developed in the boundary layer of the 1km experiment.  The mid-troposphere 
in the region with deep-convection is more than $40\%$ dryer than it is for the 2km and 1km experiments. 

Despite a fairly regular distribution of precipitation around the SST maximum for experiments with increasing resolution, the 
surface enthalpy flux reveals large differences in the symmetry.  Over the SST maximum, E25 has a surface enthalpy flux that is 
60 W/m2 larger than that of the E1 experiment, and the E1 experiment has a very irregular pattern of enthalpy flux in the middle
half of the domain.  It appears that these differences in magnitude and regularity are due to the differing wind speeds at the 
lowest atmospheric level.  It is also work noting that the E1 experiment has a stronger domain mean u wind shear compared 
with the E2 and E25 experiments.  Over the warm patch of SST, the surface enthalpy flux is decreased by the LWCRE for E25, 
E2, and E1 despite these experiments having stronger low-level winds.  This decreased enthalpy flux also corresponds to 
an increased amount of specific humidity in the lowest atmospheric model level.

\end{figure}


Because of the close connection between the domain mean value of precipitation, atmospheric condensational heating, and 
the total radiative cooling the time evolution of the precipitation serves as a useful measure of wether a model has 
reached statistical equilibrium.  Figure \ref{fig:precip_dom_mn} demonstrates that after about 30 days, the P25, E2, and E1
simulations begin to oscillate about a mean state that is roughly constant over periods greater than about 30 days. 
The large oscillations in domain mean precipitation are similar to those noted in previous studies 
(Silvers et al., 2016; Patrizio and Randall, 2019).   The experiments with a higher resolution have a lower value of domain
mean precipitation, with the E2 simulation having the lowest (3.1 mm/day).  This can be understood as a consequence
of the differences in upper level cloud fraction.   Figure \ref{fig:cf_tdtlw} shows E2 to have the largest (about 17\%) upper level mean cloud
fraction in the subsidence region, with the E1 experiment having the next largest cloud fraction (10\%), followed by E25, P25, and 
P100 (5\%).   Less upper level clouds will allow more radiative cooling of the atmosphere and require a correspondingly larger
amount of condensational heating and precipitation.

The domain mean condensate is an important measure of the steady state reached by these experiments.  The vertical 
distribution of condensate is closely related to the distribution of clouds, it influences the distribution of energy throughout
the atmosphere as well as influencing the outgoing longwave radiation.  It can also indicate the strength of convection 
and vertical mass transport.     Figure \ref{fig:TotCond} shows the domain mean condensate for P25, E25, E2, and E1
(solid lines) and the corresponding experiments with the LWCRE off (dashed lines).  There is a fundamental difference 
between the GCM-like P25/E25 experiments and the CRM-like E2/E1 experiments with the former having much 
higher values of low-level liquid condensate/cloud and the later having much higher values up upper level ice condensate.  
It is also interesting to note that the LWCRE results in less condensate above 700 hPa for all experiments, and 
more condensate below 700 hPa for the P25/E25 experiments.  The two-dimensional structure of circulation and humidity
shows that the amount of condensate aloft in the deep-convective region increases with resolution while the relative
humidity in the subsidence regions decreases with resolution.  This is consistent with an overturning circulation that 
strengthens as the resolution increases.   This dependence of circulation strength and moisture on resolution is especially 
apparent when the LWCRE is off (Figure \ref{fig:rh_psi_P25E2E1_lwoff}).  When the clouds and radiation are allowed 
to directly interact with each the E2 and E1 simulations appear much more similar (Figure \ref{fig:rh_psi_P25E2E1}).   

The E25 and P25 experiments have much less condensate aloft and a lower relative humidity in the mid-troposphere 
(can we use this to understand the differences in LWCRE?).

\end{figure}


An interesting fact that emerges from the domain mean values of precipitation with and without the LW CRE (see table 1) 
is that the response is not the same across the different grid-spacings.  
Turning the LW CRE off for the E1 and E2 results in more precipitation while for the E25, P25, and P100 experiments 
less precipitation results from turning the LW CRE off.  The primary method by which the longwave cloud radiative effect 
influences the atmosphere is by heating the atmosphere in the region between the clouds and the surface.  Larger values 
of ice condensate and upper-level cloud fraction such as we see for the E2 and E1 experiment imply a larger LW CRE relative
to the E25, P25, and P100 experiments.    
This implies there will be less atmospheric heating from 
longwave radiation and a corresponding larger heating due to condensational heating which is consistent with higher values 
of domain mean precipitation for E25, P25, and P100 compared to E2 and E1.  Similarly, the E2 experiment has lower values 
of upper level condensate and higher values of mid-troposphere relative humidity compared to the E1 simulation, which ....??  
Water vapor is an efficient emitor of long-wave radiation and thus greatly facilitates the cooling of the troposphere.  
Popp and Silvers, 2017 showed that that there is dramatically less water vapor in the atmosphere and much less precipitation 
for LW CRE off experiments (see their figure 1).  Our results here for the E25, P25, and P100 are consistent with 
those of Popp and Silvers, 2017.

There are also differences in the lapse-rate below $700 \rm{hPa}$, in the upper-level clouds,
and the domain mean precipitation (Figure \ref{fig:precip_dom_mn}).
  
\textit{probably insert figure from slides 20 and 21 of IUGG talk.}
We can see clearly that the interactions between longwave radiation and clouds act to dry the troposphere in the regions of subsidence 
more than the cases when the longwave CRE is not active.  This is especially true for the simulations with a grid-spacing of 1 km 
and 2 km.  While the mid-tropospheric profiles of diabatic heating and cooling are similar between the LW CRE on/off simulations, 
there is a very strong response below about 850 hPa for the 25km model.  At that grid-spacing, with the LW CRE on, significant 
low-level clouds are formed, leading to a radiative cooling of almost 10K/day, and a radiative cooling of around -7K/day.   However, 
when the LW CRE is off, there is no appreciable difference in the low-level diabatic profiles among the models with 3 grid-spacings.   It 
is also clearly seen that the LW CRE decreases the upper-level ice-condensate for models of all grid-spacings while dramatically 
increasing the low-level liquid condensate.  

When the LW CRE is off, the simulations with resolutions of 1km, 2km, and 25km all show a similar distribution and magnitude of surface 
enthalpy flux (Figure \ref{fig:enthalpy}).  However, when the LW CRE is on, there are differences between the resolutions that can be as 
large as $80 \, \rm{W/m^2}$.   These differences in surface enthalpy flux are due largely to the latent heat flux and are confined to the 
regions with ascending circulations over the warmer SST.  This manifestation of the strong interactions between clouds and the circulation 
would be entirely absent from high resolution simulations with gray radiation or fixed radiative cooling profiles.  


Relative to simulations with a grid-spacing of $25 \textit{km}$, the simulations with explicit convection can be characterized as having: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item stronger overturning circulations (as measured by vertical velocity) which are more consistently centered over the maximum of SST.  
  \item higher relative humidity in the upwelling regions and aloft.   Between 600-800 hPa the explicit models can have a relative humidity 
  that is 40\% higher than in the parameterized, lower resolution simulations.  
  \item two to four times more ice condensate above about 600 hPa but only about half as much liquid condensate below about 700 hPa.
  \item less domain mean precipitation.  Values for 1 and 2 km simulations are in the 3.2-3.5 mm/d range, while those for the 25 km 
  simulations are 10-20\% higher (3.5-3.9 mm/d).  
  \item a weaker radiative cooling rate (about 2 K/d) and weaker heating rate (about 2 K/d).
  \item much less vertical shear.

\section{Conclusions}

The results presented in this paper show us that (scientific point learned).    Interactions between the clouds and radiation
act to spatially concentrate the circulation, strengthen the overturning circulation, and dry out the mid-troposphere where 
subsidence dominates (although domain mean condensate is less when LWCRE is on.).  

The longwave cloud radiative effect (LWCRE) has been shown to play a dramatic role in the organization of the precipitation
field and the low-level clouds.  This is primarily accomplished by decreasing the amount of precipitation that is produced 
by the large-scale precipitation scheme.  Two major differences between the GCM-like experiments and the CRM-like 
experiments are 4-5 times more low-level clouds and a much dryer mid-troposphere in the GCM-like experiments compared 
to the CRM-like experiments.  The LWCRE also highlights the impact of an increased vertical moisture transport 
in our CRM-like models.  

Several different configurations of a mock-Walker circulation have been used to analyze the response of clouds and the 
large-scale circulation to a simple Gaussian shaped prescribed SST pattern.  To better understand the role that clouds
and humidity play in determining and driving the circulation we have performed experiments with and without the radiative
effect of clouds, with and without the deep convective parameterization, across multiple domain sizes,  
and using a range of resolutions from 100 km to 1 km grid-spacing.  Our results imply that the convective 
parameterization and the longwave cloud radiative effect strongly interact with each and often lead to 
asymmetric results.   

There is a rich literature on tropical overturning circulations.  Much of it is focused on the Hadley circulation and while some
work has looked at the Walker circulation, it has received less attention.  Part of our motivation in using the framework of the 
Walker circulation comes from the fact that all of the major types of tropical cloud types occur regularly within this circulation
and it thus serves as an ideal testbed/laboratory for studying the interactions and interdependencies of different types of 
clouds and the circulation.  While this study has interpreted the experiments in the context of the Walker Circulation, our results 
are also relevant to the deep overturning circulations and meridional SST gradients that define the ITCZ and the Hadley 
Circulation.  In that context, our results are consistent with those of several recent studies (e.g. Harrop and Hartmann, 2016, 
Popp and Silvers, 2017, Dixit et al. 2018, Flaschner et al. 2018).  These studies, as well as the present one, all show that the 
LWCRE acts to constrain the deep convective region.  This results from an increased atmospheric energy uptake and 
strengthening of the overturning circulation where the deep convective clouds occur (Popp and Silvers, 2017).  Consistent with 
these papers, the present work also shows that the LWCRE has a strong influence on the low-level circulation.   When 
the LWCRE is turned off, the low-level circulations shift upward and are not as well organized (reference psi figures).
There is a corresponding change in the low-level cloud fields, longwave radiative cooling, and the domain mean precipitation.
For the experiments with a GCM-like configuration, the LWCRE strongly influences the precipitation from the large-scale
cloud scheme while leaving the precipitation from the convective parameterization scheme largely unchanged.  This leads 
to a much stronger response of the GCM-like experiments to the LWCRE, especially in the low-levels of the troposphere.  
Because we expect the fraction of precipitation that is due to the convective parameterization to be model dependent 
this could explain why GCMs have a large spread in their response to turning off the LWCRE (reference some 
of Aiko's work?). 

We have used the tropical overturning circulation to compare the multi-scale interactions between circulation patterns, cloud 
systems, and interactive radiation across experiments with grid-spacing ranging from 100km to 1km.  The flexible modeling
system at GFDL has allowed us to use a single code base in a GCM-like configuration with physics parameterizations 
that are very close to the AM4.0/CM4.0 models as well as in a CRM-like configuration with explicit convection.  While 
there are significant differences between the CRM presented in this paper and more conventional CRMs (e.g. vertical 
grid spacing and threshold based `binary' cloud scheme), the prospect of so easily converting a GCM into something 
like a CRM allows for an enticing testbed for future model development.
These comparisons have highlighted some of the unexpected behaviors of a GCM-like configuration when used with 
highly idealized boundary conditions.  For example, the consistent asymmetry of the circulation and precipitation relative 
to the fixed SST pattern and the dominance of the large-scale precipitation over the convective precipitation.  
The comparisons have also illustrated some 
of the challenges that arise when dramatically increasing the resolution of a GCM.  For example, the lack of shallow 
clouds (both convective and stratocumulus) and the difficulty of comparing clouds in this CRM to other CRMs due to the 
prognostic large-scale cloud scheme used at GFDL.

The goal in developing and using idealized models is to capitalize on their simplicity and learn something about the 
parent system as a result.  Idealized studies focusing on particular parts of the Earth system have shown that the danger of 
such idealized models is that they will not actually be less complex or easier to understand than the Earth system.  

The only difference between our simulations and radiative convective equilibrium is a gradient of SST at the lower boundary.
The addition of this small difference creates an undeniable link with the observed tropical atmosphere.  The idealized 
mock -Walker cell configuration serves as an important step between models of pure radiative convective equilibrium
and models which are applicable to a wider range of Earth like conditions.  


Although the radiative cooling and condensational heating
 are in many ways similar...   The 1 and 2 \textit{km} experiments transport much more condensate aloft and maintain a 
 relative humidity over the warm pool region that is about 40\% higher than the experiments with parameterized convection.

\section{Streamfunction}

For a two-dimensional flow in the $\lambda,p$ plane we can write the mass conservation equation in terms of a 
mass streamfunction $\psi$ as: 
\begin{equation}
u =  -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial p}   \,\, {\rm and} \,\, \omega =\frac{\partial \psi}{a \rm{cos} \phi \partial \lambda}
\end{equation}
with $a$ as the radius of Earth.
This satisfies the continuity equation: 
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{a \rm{cos} \phi\partial\lambda}\left(-\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial p}\right)+\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\left(\frac{\partial \psi}{a \rm{cos}\phi \partial \lambda}\right)=0.
\end{equation}
The streamfunction is therefore defined by two equations and can be solved with either.  The choice is often made based on the 
boundary conditions.  Dimensionally, $\psi$ must have units of velocity multiplied by pressure, or $\rm{kg/s^3}$.  Often, the streamfunction
is computed as a mass streamfunction with units of $\rm{kg/s}$.  Density does not appear above
because pressure is being used as the vertical coordinate.   With height as the vertical coordinate, mass is given by $\rho dxdydz$, 
assuming a hydrostatic atmosphere and rewriting in terms of pressure mass is given by $-(1/g) dxdydp$.
Scaling the equations above by $a/g$ results in $\psi$ having units of $\rm{kg/s}$.  

Solving for $\psi$ by integrating the vertical velocity is possible, but requires a boundary condition along one edge of the domain between the surface and the 
top of the atmosphere.  Solving for $\psi$ by integrating the horizontal velocity allows us to set $\psi=0$ along the upper edge of the domain.  
This is both simple, and physically motivated.

\begin{equation}
\psi_{i,j+1}= \psi_{i,j}-\frac{a}{g}\sum_{j=32}^1 \left(u_{i,j+1}(p_{j+1}-p_{j})\right).
\end{equation}

In the previous equation, $w, u,$ and $\rho$ have all been averaged in space and time and $p$ is the pressure on full model levels.  The 
radius of Earth is $a$ and the acceleration due to gravity by $g$.  The density, $\rho$ is computed as $ \rho_{i,j}=\frac{p_j}{R T_{v;i,j}}  $  where $R$ and $T_v$ are the gas constant for dry air ($287 \rm{J/kg K}$) and the virtual temperature ($T_v=T(1+q/\epsilon)/(1+q)$), respectively.  The specific humidity is given by $q$ and $\epsilon = 0.622$.


\section{Cloud Water and Cloud Fraction}

The last several generations of the GFDL atmospheric models have used the parameterization developed by Tiedtke (1993) to prognostically compute the grid-cell averaged cloud water ($l$) and cloud fraction ($a$).  The formulation for the local time rate of change from Tiedtke is 
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial l}{\partial t} = A(l)+S_{cv}+S_{BL}+C-E-G_{p}-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(\rho\overline{w'l'})_{entr}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial a}{\partial t} = A(a)+S(a)_{cv}+S(a)_{BL}+S(a)_C-D(a).
\end{equation}
Transport of $l$ or $a$ through the boundaries of a grid is given by $A(l)$ or $A(a)$, the terms ($S_{cv}, S(a)_{cv}, S_{BL}, S(a)_{BL}$, and $S(a)_C$) are the sources of cloud water or cloud fraction from convection, boundary layer turbulence, and condensation, respectively.  The condensation/sublimation rate is given by $C$, $E$ is the evaporation of cloud water, $G_{p}$ is the rate of generation of precipitation by microphysical processes and the $\overline{w'l'}$ term is the flux divergence from entrainment at the top of the cloud layer, and lastly, $D(a)$ is the sink of cloud fraction due to evaporation.

Often, cloud resolving models, or cloud system resolving models, do not predict partially cloudy grid cells, but rather consider a cell to be either cloudy or clear.  If the goal is to more directly compare to cloud resolving models then cloud fraction should not be prognostically predicted but simply tied to a certain value of total condensate in a grid-cell.  However, in the Tiedtke system, the prognostic equation for cloud water depends on the cloud fraction.  As given by equations 16, 24, 26,28, 30, and 33 in Tiedtke's paper, this dependence is present in the $S_{BL}$, $C$, $E$, and $G_{p}$ terms.
