abstract="An idealized two-dimensional mock-Walker circulation in the tropical atmosphere forced by prescribed horizontal gradients in sea-surface temperature (SST) is discussed. This model problem includes feedbacks between cumulus convection and tropical large-scale circulations that have proved challenging for global climate models to predict accurately. Three-dimensional cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulations that explicitly simulate turbulent circulations within individual cloud systems across 4,096 and 1,024 km-wide Walker circulations are compared with a simple theoretical model, the Simplified Quasiequilibrium Tropical Circulation Model (SQTCM). This theoretical model combines the weak-temperature-gradient approximation with a unimodal truncation of tropospheric vertical structure coupled to highly simplified formulations of moist precipitating cumulus convection and its cloud-radiative feedbacks. The rainfall, cloud and humidity distribution, circulation strength, energy fluxes and scaling properties are compared between the models. The CRM-simulated horizontal distribution of rainfall and energy fluxes are adequately predicted by the SQTCM. However, the humidity distribution (drier subsidence regions and high-humidity boundary layers in the CRM), vertical structure and domain-size scaling of the circulation differ significantly between the models. For the SQTCM, the concept of gross moist stability -- related to advection of moist static energy (MSE) out of tropospheric columns by the mean divergent circulation -- is used to explain the width and intensity of the rainy region. Column MSE budgets averaged across the ascent branch of the simulated Walker circulation provide similar insight into the cloud-resolving simulations after consideration of the more complex horizontal and vertical circulation structure and the role of transient eddies. A nondimensional ascent-region moist stability ratio $\alpha$, analogous to the SQTCM gross moist stability, is developed. One term of $\alpha$ is related to the vertical profiles of ascent-region mean vertical motion and ascent-region edge MSE; a second term is proportional to eddy export from the ascent region. Smaller $\alpha$ induces a narrower, rainier ascent region. The sensitivity of the SQTCM and CRM to a uniform 2 K increase in SST is compared, and the rainy upward branch of the circulation narrows in both models. MSE budget arguments are used to explain this behavior. In the simple model, the gross moist stability is a decreasing function of tropospheric temperature. Hence gross moist stability reduces and the ascent region narrows as the SST increases. In the CRM, increased atmospheric radiative cooling due to the warmer and moister troposphere destabilizes the MSE profile and decreases $\alpha$, inducing a narrower ascent region. In the CRM, and to a lesser extent in the SQTCM, intensified shortwave cloud forcing in the warmer climate causes a negative radiative feedback on the SST change.",

%abstract = {Convective self-aggregation refers to a phenomenon in cloud-resolving simulations wherein the atmosphere spontaneously develops a circulation with a convecting moist patch and a nonconvecting dry patch. All previous studies have found a sharp transition to aggregated convection when the domain size exceeds a critical threshold, typically in the range of 200–300 km. Here, we show that cold pools are responsible for this sharp transition. When cold pools are inhibited, self-aggregation occurs at all domain sizes. In this case, the aggregation strength decreases smoothly as the domain size L is decreased below about 200–300 km. A streamfunction analysis reveals two distinct sources for the air subsiding into the dry-patch boundary layer: a moist, shallow circulation and a dry, deep circulation. The deep circulation scales with L, whereas the shallow circulation does not. At small L, the shallow circulation dominates, thereby weakening the aggregation.},

    abstract = { Abstract It has long been known that trade wind cumulus and deep cumulonimbus represent primary components of the broad spectrum of cumulus clouds in the Tropics, which has led to the concept of a bimodal distribution of tropical clouds. However, recent analyses of shipboard radar data from Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) provide evidence of abundant populations of a third cloud type, cumulus congestus. Congestus clouds constitute over half the precipitating convective clouds in COARE and contribute over one-quarter of the total convective rainfall. Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment studies reveal a similar midlevel peak in the distribution of radar-echo tops. These findings lead to the conclusion that shallow cumulus, congestus, and cumulonimbus are all prominent tropical cumulus cloud types. They are associated with trimodal distributions of divergence, cloud detrainment, and fractional cloudiness in the Tropics. The peaks in the distributions of radar-echo tops for these three cloud types are in close proximity to prominent stable layers that exist over the Pacific warm pool and the tropical eastern Atlantic: near 2 km (the trade stable layer), ∼5 km (near 0°C), and ∼15–16 km (the tropopause). These stable layers are inferred to inhibit cloud growth and promote cloud detrainment. The 0°C stable layer can produce detrainment from cumulonimbi (attendant shelf clouds) and help retard the growth of precipitation-laden and strongly entraining congestus clouds. Moreover, restriction of growth of congestus clouds to just above the 0°C level limits further enhancement of cloud buoyancy through glaciation. The three cloud types are found to vary significantly during COARE on the timescale of the 30–60-day intraseasonal oscillation. The specific roles of clouds of the congestus variety in the general circulation are not yet clear, but some (the shallower ones) contribute to moistening and preconditioning the atmosphere for deep convection; others (the deeper ones) contribute an important fraction of the total tropical rainfall, and both likely produce many midlevel clouds, thereby modulating the radiative heating of the tropical atmosphere. }

We used doubly periodic square domains of widths 768, 1,536, 3,072, and 6,144 km, over 350 simulated days. In the 768-, 1,536-, and 3,072-km domains, the simulations produced circular convective clusters surrounded by broader regions of dry, subsiding air. In the 6,144-km domain, the convection ultimately forms two semiconnected bands. As the domain size increases, equilibrated CSA moistens in two ways. First, as the circulation widens, this leads to stronger boundary layer winds and a more humid boundary layer. Second, the stronger inflow into the convective region boundary layer is associated with a warmer convective region boundary layer, which leads to intensified deep convection, more melting and freezing near the freezing level, enhanced midlevel stability, increased congestus activity, and detrainment of moist air into the dry region. In the larger domains, the deep convection and congestus slowly oscillate out of phase with each other with a time period of about 25 to 30 days. We hypothesize that other important domain size sensitivities, including a decrease in net moist static energy export from the convective region, are fundamentally linked to the increasing relationship between domain size and boundary layer wind speed. Our results suggest that the statistics of CSA converge only for domains wider than about 3,000 km.},

%    abstract = { AbstractA major bias in tropical precipitation over the Pacific in climate simulations stems from the models’ tendency to produce two strong distinct intertropical convergence zones (ITCZs) too often. Several mechanisms have been proposed that may contribute to the emergence of two ITCZs, but current theories cannot fully explain the bias. This problem is tackled by investigating how the interaction between atmospheric cloud-radiative effects (ACREs) and the large-scale circulation influences the ITCZ position in an atmospheric general circulation model. Simulations are performed in an idealized aquaplanet setup and the longwave and shortwave ACREs are turned off individually or jointly. The low-level moist static energy (MSE) is shown to be a good predictor of the ITCZ position. Therefore, a mechanism is proposed that explains the changes in MSE and thus ITCZ position due to ACREs consistently across simulations. The mechanism implies that the ITCZ moves equatorward if the Hadley circulation strengthens because of the increased upgradient advection of low-level MSE off the equator. The longwave ACRE increases the meridional heating gradient in the tropics and as a response the Hadley circulation strengthens and the ITCZ moves equatorward. The shortwave ACRE has the opposite effect. The total ACRE pulls the ITCZ equatorward. This mechanism is discussed in other frameworks involving convective available potential energy, gross moist stability, and the energy flux equator. It is thus shown that the response of the large-scale circulation to the shortwave and longwave ACREs is a fundamental driver of changes in the ITCZ position. }

    abstract = { AbstractAn idealized Walker cell with prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) and prescribed radiative cooling is studied using both a two-dimensional cloud-resolving model (CRM) and a simple conceptual model. In the CRM, for the same SST distribution, the width of the warm pool (area of strong precipitation) varies systematically with the magnitude of the radiative cooling, narrowing as radiative cooling is increased. The simple model is constructed to interpret these behaviors. Key aspects of the simple model include a surface wind determined from the boundary layer momentum budget, which in turn sets evaporation assuming a spatially uniform surface relative humidity, prescribed gross moist and dry stratification as a function of column water vapor and precipitation, and a gustiness enhancement on evaporation in areas of precipitation. It is found that the gustiness enhancement, likely due to mesoscale systems, creates a feedback that narrows the warm pool. This process has not been included in previous formulations of the simple model and its role is emphasized here. }

This version, with roughly 100 km horizontal resolution and 33 levels in the vertical, contains an aerosol model that generates aerosol fields from emissions and a “light” chemistry mechanism designed to support the aerosol model but with prescribed ozone. In Part 1, the quality of the simulation in AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) mode—with prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea-ice distribution—is described and compared with previous GFDL models and with the CMIP5 archive of AMIP simulations. The model's Cess sensitivity (response in the top-of-atmosphere radiative flux to uniform warming of SSTs) and effective radiative forcing are also presented. In Part 2, the model formulation is described more fully and key sensitivities to aspects of the model formulation are discussed, along with the approach to model tuning.},
